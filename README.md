Here are some challenges I faced during making the Book Application.

Backend Setup: Configuring CodeIgniter and setting up proper routes for CRUD operations can be tricky, especially when dealing with form validation and database connections.

Frontend with Vue.js: Getting Vue to communicate smoothly with the backend, handling API requests, and managing state (like updating the book list) can pose difficulties.

Database Design: Ensuring correct relationships between entities and enforcing data validation, like unique ISBNs or proper date formats, might require extra attention.

Styling & UX: Creating a clean, responsive interface while keeping CSS simple can sometimes slow you down, especially if youâ€™re doing it from scratch.

Local Environment Issues: Troubleshooting problems with MAMP or switching to Docker could delay progress.
